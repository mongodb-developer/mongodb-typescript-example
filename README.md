## Introduction
Welcome to this MongoDB and Typescript sample project. 
The aim of this project is to give you a working example of how you can use the power of MongoDB Atlas with Typescript and Express to create modern web applications.

## Running the project
In order to run this project:

1. Create a .env file in the root of the project with the same properties as env.example
2. Update the values with your connection string, database name and collection name
3. run `npm run start`

## Branches
This app has two branches `main` and `finish`.

`main` will contain the boilerplate code to get you started, following the instructions in the companion blog post (TBA).
`finish` contains a working example complete with CRUD operations and schema validation. This is how `main` will look after following the tutorial. This also gives a working example for anyone looking for a final copy and not intending to follow the post.
